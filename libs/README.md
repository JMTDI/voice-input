# Libraries

The libraries in this directory can be rebuilt from their sources:
* pocketfft-release.aar - [PocketFFT JNI bindings](https://gitlab.futo.org/alex/pocketfft-jni)
* vad-release.aar - [android-vad fork](https://github.com/abb128/android-vad)
* [TensorFlow Lite](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) - optimized builds are used to reduce APK size. Read more about optimized tflite builds [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/reduce_binary_size)

In the future it may be a better idea to pull these from a self-hosted repository or similar but for now this is simpler
