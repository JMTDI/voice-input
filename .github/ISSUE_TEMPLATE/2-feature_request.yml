        # Thank you for opening a feature request.

        The [voice-input](https://github.com/futo-org/voice-input) issue tracker is reserved for issues relating to the FUTO Voice Input Android Application

        For discussion related to enhancements, please see the [FUTO Keyboard Zulip Channel](https://chat.futo.org/#narrow/stream/53-Keyboard) or the [FUTO Keyboard Discord](https://keyboard.futo.org/discord)

        Please open feature requests one at a time. If you have 3 separate feature requests/bugs, do not combine them into one issue, this makes it really difficult to track and understand them.

        Before opening a feature request, please make sure you're using the latest version of the keyboard, it may have already been added.
